# VideoGame_DataAnalysis
Fundamentals of Python  Personal Project.

Prompt:
Create a Unique dataset using a dictionary with nested dictionaries and lists within for a more descriptive database. I specifically created a dataset using video games,
with key value pairs of a games unique ID, name, price, system, dlc status (True or False), dlcInfo (If dlc status is true), series status (True or False), and seriesInfo (If series status is True). Using this dataset, I then created functions that print the unique values from that database (dlc values and series values). Then, I made a function that takes in the game data and uses a While loop to ask the user what games they want to buy and allows them to checkout, printing a purchase receipt after checkout is entered.
